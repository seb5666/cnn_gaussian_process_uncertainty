# CNN uncertainty with Gaussian processes

## Main task
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks, but provide no measure of confidence in their predictions. Use the Keras MNIST example CNN available at [https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py). After training the model, use the outputs from the top level feature layer before the softmax classifier to train a Gaussian Process classifier on the MNIST data. Evaluate your classifierâ€™s performance compared to the original CNN with softmax classifier. Plot the distribution of classification uncertainties for correctly and incorrectly classified samples. 

## Extension
Without re-training, use your model to classify the n-MNIST dataset [http://csc.lsu.edu/~saikat/n-mnist/](http://csc.lsu.edu/~saikat/n-mnist/), again plotting the classification uncertainties. Investigate how adversarial perturbations to the MNIST data affect classification accuracy and uncertainty (try the CleverHans toolbox for generating adversarial perturbations).
